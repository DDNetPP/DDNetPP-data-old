the folder "very_old"
holds some old randomly backupped databases

the folder "latest_accounts"
is managed by the backup_accounts.sh script which
backups all 12h the current accounts.db from ddpp_database/accounts.db
and then deletes the oldest (accounts_backup.db)
so if you want to check the latest update you have to search for
"accounts_backup22.db" #or the highest number if this script gets updated
